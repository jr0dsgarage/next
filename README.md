next is a World of Warcraft addon that highlights potential enemy targets, helping the player decide which enemy they should target next.
<br>
<br>
The target highlighter uses the in-game tooltip information about each enemy within nameplate range to determine what to highlight, and the quest log to determine what color to use.

## Features

- **Smart Quest Highlighting:**
  - Automatically highlights nameplates for mobs relevant to your active tasks:
    - **Quest Objectives**: Standard kill/collect quests.
    - **Quest Items**: Mobs that drop quest items (even if not a direct kill objective).
    - **World Quests**: Targets for active world quests.
    - **Bonus Objectives**: Targets for area bonus objectives.
- **Current Target Indicator:**
  - Distinct highlight for your currently selected target.
- **Customizable Styles:**
  - Choose from multiple visual styles for each highlight type:
    - **Blizzard**: Uses the native Blizzard selection texture (clean & integrated).
    - **Outline**: Draws a colored border around the health bar.
    - **Glow**: Adds a soft glow effect around the health bar.
  - Configure **Color**, **Thickness**, and **Offset** for each type independently.
  - Settings panel available in Interface > AddOns or via `/next config`.

## Examples
Highlight the current target if its a quest objective.  Keep track of what's an objective and what's not (the Feral Ghoul is not an objective)
